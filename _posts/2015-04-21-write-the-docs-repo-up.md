<img src="/images/write-the-docs-logo.png" alt="Write the Docs logo" style="float:right;PADDING-LEFT: 10px;PADDING-BOTTOM: 10px;height="200" width="200"">Just to keep things neat and tidy, I've [started a repo](https://github.com/gaylin/WriteTheDocsNA2015) specifically for my Write the Docs NA 2015 talk that I'm going to be giving. It's currently got links to [the abstract](http://www.writethedocs.org//conf/na/2015/speakers/#speaker-gwalli) I submitted (in a fit of insomnia), some [credits for images](https://github.com/gaylin/WriteTheDocsNA2015/blob/master/credits.md) I've used to date, placeholders for things like the links to the actual slide presentation, and some notes.

I'm feelin' all productive, y'all.
