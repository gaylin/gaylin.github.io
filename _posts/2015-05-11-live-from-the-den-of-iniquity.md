For all my sassy brash and bravado, I'm a pathetic sop when it comes to my anniversary. I leave these little heart-shaped post it notes around the house describing all the things I love about being married to MrMr. He swears it's adorable. (And he still keeps the old notes, so he can't be fibbing too hard on that.) Understandably then, the idea of being separated from MrMr on my anniversary was, shall we say, a bit distasteful. Doable, but less than ideal.

You see, MrMr's company decided it might be a good idea to send him on a company business trip this week. It also happens to be the week of our wedding anniversary. If it were a separation of just a few days, I suppose, that wouldn't be a big deal. We'd simply wait until the weekend to celebrate, have a grand time doing what married folk do on their anniversary, and poof. Another year pleasantly surprised that the other of us stuck around for so long given how hard we both think it is to live with our selves.

Except that this time, before MrMr would arrive home, I'd be on my way to Portland to attend Write the Docs 2015, which would mean that we'd be separated for yet another weekend and at least three quarters of a week more while we traded sides of the US. That clearly wasn't going to work.

So this week, I find myself ensconced in The Venetian hotel in Las Vegas, which I'm sure makes nearly everyone think "OMG I wish I could work remotely from Las Vegas!" Yeah, no. This is really a working vacation. 

I do get to see MrMr every night, but we don't get to see each other during the day at all really. I'm still writing docs, he's still working, and we go on with our day much the same as we would if we were at home. I'm just in a less comfy chair, and in a room with better air conditioning than my home office. 

In fact, this is my view most of the day this week:

But tomorrow we'll celebrate spending more than half of our lives living together, supporting each other, and generally being sappy old married folk together, even if it is amidst the noise and bustle and heat of this "den of iniquity" as my mother once called it

I love you, MrMr. I'm glad you're in my life.
