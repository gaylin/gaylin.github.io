So, a conference proposal I submitted in a latenight bout with insomnia got unexpectedly accepted. Happy, excited, and weirded out that people would want to listen to me talk about the synergies[1] between martial arts and writing and technology. Yeah, all those things describe me right about now.

Sure it's not for the full 30 minutes[2]. A 15 minute talk is still a great amount of time, right? More than a lightning talk, less than ... well, less than the potential to bore someone stupid, I suppose.

It looks like this is really gonna happen. I gotta go meditate.

- [1] Oh god did I really use that word? Please don't think I'm [a douchebag](http://unsuck-it.com/synergy/).
- [2] Good lord I had 45 minutes worth of material already trying to be cut down. I'm so screwed.
