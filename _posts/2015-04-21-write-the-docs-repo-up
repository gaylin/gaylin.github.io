Just to keep things neat and tidy, I've started a repo specifically for my Write the Docs NA 2015 talk that I'm going to be giving. It's currently got links to the abstract I submitted (in a fit of insomnia), some key research bits I've used to date, and some placeholders for the links to the actual slide presentation and some notes.

I'm feelin' all productive, y'all.
