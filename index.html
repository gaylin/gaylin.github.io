				<p>So I got this bright idea that maybe I should expand myself out beyond the idiot-savant knowledge I have of stuff for my job. Sure, I publish docs every day. Sometimes I even manipulate how they look. But mostly I just provide content, with minor style tweaks the same way. Basically stuff any schlub with knowledge of Markdown or HTML might be able to do.</p>
				<p>But I'm aiming for something more. It might take a while. I might be slow at it. And I'm sure I'll make a lot of whacked mistakes. Try to be kind. I'm new at this.</p>
				<p>Welcome to my playground.</p>
