# About this site
So I got this bright idea that maybe I should expand myself out beyond the idiot-savant knowledge I have of stuff for my job. Sure, I publish docs every day. Sometimes I even manipulate how they look. But mostly I just provide content, with minor style tweaks the same way. Basically stuff any schlub with knowledge of Markdown or HTML might be able to do.

But I'm aiming for something more. It might take a while. I might be slow at it. And I'm sure I'll make a lot of whacked mistakes. Until I get a better handle on things, think of it as a sandbox that's been randomly visited by stray cats without my knowledge. The site uses:

- English for text, until I can master another (blame auto-correct for the typos)
- [HPSTR](https://mademistakes.com/work/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) as a Jekyll theme, until I come up with my own (blame me for wonk)

Try to be kind. I'm new at this. Welcome to my playground.
