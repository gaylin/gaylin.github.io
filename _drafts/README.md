The [jekyll docs on drafts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/) says:

>To preview your site with drafts, simply run `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts` switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

This is where I'll store draft blog posts that I don't want to just store locally.
